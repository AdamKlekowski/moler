If you want to run all examples totally without code changes you need to have same execution environment as me ;-)
Otherwise you need to do OS and Python adaptation by yourself.

* I run Linux Debian under Oracle VirtualBox
* exercises utilizing connection to remote machine will require: machine name, user login and password
* my machine is named ute-image9
  * to change your hostname to such name google for: "debian command to change hostname"
* I have created user 'moler' with password 'moler'
  * to create user & password: login as root and fire command 'adduser moler'
    (if you see 'BAD PASSWORD: it is too short' or 'is too simple' ignore it and keep repeating 'moler' as password)
* I have added 'moler' user to sudoers - inside directory /etc/sudoers.d/ create file 'moler' (as root) with content:
    moler  ALL=NOPASSWD:  ALL
* for experiment with running 'ifconfig' command we need to know it's location
  * as root fire command 'which ifconfig'; my output is '/sbin/ifconfig'; add to /etc/sudoers.d/moler commented line:
    #moler  ALL=(ALL) /sbin/ifconfig
* for running python I use python3.6 as /usr/bin/python3 - you may need to change symbolic link, mine was:
  sudo ln -sf /opt/ute/python3/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python3
* logs creation assumes specific location so, replicate moler repository in same directory:
  cd /home/moler
  mkdir gitrepos
  git clone https://github.com/nokia/moler.git gitrepos/moler
